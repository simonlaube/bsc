\chapter{Abstract}
In a wireless sensor network with intermittent connectivity, continuous operation requires unsupervised resource management. This project builds a demonstrator for sampling-rate adaption and data thinning that is dependend on memory availability and data drainage progress. The distributed system will consist of constrained devices running on solar power.
