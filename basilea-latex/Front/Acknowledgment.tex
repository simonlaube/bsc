\chapter{Acknowledgments}
I would like to thank Prof. Dr. Christian Tschudin for letting me work on a very interesting topic and guiding me through the project. I received a lot of suggestions on how I could improve different aspects of the project and got help whenever questions came up. I would also like to thank Dr. Erick Lavoie who helped inspire me to settle with this thesis idea at the start of the three month project. Further I would like to thank Maximilian Barth who worked on a similar project and implemented parts of the TinySSB version that I was able to use as a basis for my implementation.
