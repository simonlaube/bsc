abstract = {Secure Scuttlebutt (SSB) is a novel peer-to-peer event-sharing protocol and architecture for social apps. In this paper we describe SSB's features, its operations as well as the rationale behind the design. We also provide a comparison with Named Data Networking (NDN), an existing information-centric networking architecture, to motivate a larger exploration of the design space for information-centric networking primitives by formulating an identity-centric approach. We finally discuss SSB's limitations and evolution opportunities.},

abstract="Low power wide area (LPWA) technologies becomes popular for IoT use cases because LPWA is enable the broad range communications and allows to transmit small amounts of information in a long distance. Among LPWA technologies there are LTE-M, SigFox, LoRa, Symphony Link, Ingenu RPMA, Weightless, and NB-IoT. Currently all these technologies suffer from lack of documentation about deployment recommendation, have non-investigated limitations that can affect implementations and products using such technologies. This paper is focused on the testing of LPWAN LoRa technology to learn how a LoRa network gets affected by different environmental attributes such as distance, height and surrounding area by measuring the signal strength, signal to noise ratio and any resulting packet loss. The series of experiments for various use cases are conducted using a fully deployed LoRa network made up of a gateway and sensor available through the public network. The results will show the LoRa network limitation for such use cases as forest, city, open space. These results allow to give the recommendation for companies during early analysis and design stages of network life circle, and help to choose properly technology for deployment an IoT application.",

abstract = {Long Range (LoRa) is a Low-power Wide-area Network technology designed for the Internet of Things. In recent years, it has gained significant momentum among industrial and research communities. Patented by Semtech, LoRa makes use of chirp spread spectrum modulation to deliver data with promises of long battery life, far-reaching communication distances, and a high node density at the cost of data rate. In this article, we conduct a series of experiments to verify the claims made by Semtech on LoRa technology. Our results show that LoRa is capable of communicating over 10km under line-of-sight environments. However, under non-line-of-sight environments, LoRa’s performance is severely affected by obstructions such as buildings and vegetations. Moreover, the promise of prolonged battery life requires extreme tuning of parameters. Last, a LoRa gateway supports up to 6,000 nodes with PRR requirement of >70%. This study also explores the relationship between LoRa transmission parameters and proposes an algorithm to determine optimal settings in terms of coverage and power consumption under non-line-of-sight environments. It further investigates the impact of LoRa Wide-area Networks on energy consumption and network capacity along with implementation of a LoRa medium access mechanism and possible gains brought forth by implementing such a mechanism.},
